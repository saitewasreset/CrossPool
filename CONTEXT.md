# CrossPool

CrossPool separates attention-side serving from FFN weight residency and
computation while retaining one generation-scoped data plane.

## Language

**CrossPool**:
The resource-disaggregated multi-model serving system described by this glossary.

Avoidance notes distinguish domain concepts in discussion and documentation.
They do not prohibit citing existing implementation symbols by their actual
names or require those symbols to be renamed.

Use `KV Cache` or `KV` in documentation, comments, and docstrings. Keep the
phrase as two title-cased words; never hyphenate it or lowercase its second
word. Executable identifiers may use `kv_cache` or `kv`.

**Device**:
A physical AI accelerator used for CrossPool computation, distinct from the
process-local index used to address it. Platform-specific APIs and mechanisms
retain their precise technical names.
_Avoid_: GPU or CUDA device when referring to the platform-neutral domain concept

**Deployment Device View**:
The ordered physical Devices selected for one deployment. Configured Device
indices identify positions in this view, distinct from host inventory indices
and logical role ranks.
_Avoid_: Host device numbering, Instance Rank order

**Instance**:
A configured model-serving deployment whose workers share the deployed model's
Model ID and one Fabric Instance Plan.
_Avoid_: InstanceRankRuntime, model process

**Model ID**:
The `namespace/name` identity of one model, preserving its spelling independently
of its local checkpoint path or particular serving deployment.
_Avoid_: Checkpoint path, model directory

**Benchmark Target**:
One model-serving endpoint measured in a benchmark case, identified by its Model
ID and corresponding to a configured Instance or an externally supplied endpoint.
Each Model ID has one Target within a case; aggregate measurements are derived
across Targets rather than another Target.
_Avoid_: Benchmark Instance, aggregate target

**Serving Benchmark Case**:
A concrete serving-performance experiment fixing its declared models, deployment
conditions, prompt inputs or generation parameters, and arrival process. It is
distinct from its executions, observed environments and retained measurements.
_Avoid_: Workload template, benchmark run

**Benchmark Measurement**:
Client-observed timing, token progress and request outcomes from one benchmark
workload execution, independent of their presentation.
_Avoid_: Benchmark Report, plotted results

**Benchmark Report**:
An offline presentation derived from retained Benchmark Measurements and their
deployment conditions, without another serving execution.
_Avoid_: Benchmark execution, measurement run

**Instance Rank**:
One SGLang worker process within an Instance, owning rank-local attention
execution and one Transport attachment.
_Avoid_: InstanceRankRuntime rank, Instance process

**Attention World**:
The complete attention-side rank set backed by the shared AtnAgent Fleet. Each
Instance covers this World through attention DP groups of attention TP ranks.
_Avoid_: Attention TP width, per-model rank subset

**Prefill Context Parallelism**:
The SGLang execution mode that partitions Prefill token rows among attention
context-parallel ranks for attention computation. SGLang may preserve those
rank-local rows or gather them before an FFN boundary, depending on the model,
communicator, and expert-dispatch path.
_Avoid_: Attention TP, Decode Context Parallelism

**Decode Context Parallelism**:
The SGLang execution mode that partitions Decode KV positions within a
tensor-parallel group and combines partial attention results. It is distinct
from Prefill token-row partitioning and does not by itself define a new FFN
row partition.
_Avoid_: Prefill Context Parallelism, Decode TP

**Fabric Executable**:
A Fabric generation whose participants have activated their data-plane
resources, allowing Instance Ranks to attach Transport. It does not imply that
an Instance scheduler or public serving endpoint has finished starting.
_Avoid_: System ready, Serving healthy

**System Ready**:
The daemon verdict that the configured CrossPool processes and generation-scoped
data plane are ready for every Instance scheduler. It is distinct from public
serving-endpoint health.
_Avoid_: Fabric executable, HTTP ready

**Serving Listener**:
The host and port declared by one Instance for its public serving interface.
It is a bind target, not evidence that the socket is accepting requests.
_Avoid_: Instance Rank endpoint, healthy endpoint

**Serving Healthy**:
The one-time post-System-Ready observation that every configured Instance's
public HTTP health check has succeeded for the current listener snapshot. It
is not continuous availability monitoring or a Fabric lifecycle phase.
_Avoid_: System ready, Fabric executable, serving monitor

**Elastic KV Cache Pooling**:
Attention-side capacity management that lends and reclaims physical KV memory
among co-located Instance Ranks while preserving Instance isolation and
SGLang's logical cache semantics. Reclamation may evict reclaimable cached
suffixes before releasing their physical backing.
_Avoid_: Shared KV Cache, KV Cache content sharing

**KV Capacity Pool**:
The physical-memory capacity available for KV mappings across the Instance
Ranks colocated on one attention device.
_Avoid_: Global KV Cache, KV tensor pool

**Attention Runtime Headroom**:
One Instance Rank's immutable byte budget for service-time attention memory
kept outside its attention device's KV Capacity Pool. The daemon sums these
declarations per device. It is distinct from the configured utilization margin
and the one-time device-memory observation.
_Avoid_: KV margin, live memory usage, free-memory report

**KV Control Channel**:
The daemon-owned, Fabric-Generation-scoped host-local control surface that
connects per-device KV Capacity Pools, logical KV Capacity Groups, and their
rank-local partitions. It carries capacity demand, adjustment commands, group
coordination, and physical completion observations.
_Avoid_: KV Capacity Channel, AtnAgent channel, TP-group channel, KV data channel

**KV Capacity Group**:
The Instance ranks for one `(model_id, atn_dp_rank)` that share a logical KV
capacity target across their tensor-parallel shards.
_Avoid_: TP pool, KV allocation group

**KV Capacity Target**:
The group-wide number of physical KV page bundles that each local partition is
currently authorized to back and must converge toward, distinct from the
physical page bundles still backed.
_Avoid_: Desired capacity, KV limit, KV budget bytes

**KV Active Capacity**:
The group-wide KV page-bundle prefix currently exposed to every logical
allocator in a KV Capacity Group, after all of its local partitions have the
required physical backing.
_Avoid_: Applied target, mapped capacity, active requests

**KV Capacity Command**:
A distinct group capacity adjustment with a fixed target. The daemon authorizes
the target; the group coordinates safe application and reports its outcome.

**KV Capacity Demand**:
The Capacity Group leader's persistent latest-state report of the completed
capacity operation evaluated by scheduling and the absolute bundle capacity
required by one unresolved authoritative admission-failure witness, paired with
that witness's scheduler-local SLO deadline. It is state, not a consumed pressure
event.
_Avoid_: KV pressure, capacity request event, one-bundle request

**KV Capacity Completion**:
One partition's terminal report that a Capacity Command has been applied and
its physical backing has reached the reported bundle count.

**KV Page Bundle**:
One rank-local compound VMM mapping unit covering the same KV page index across
every local attention layer and K/V buffer. Its byte size is derived from
immutable local geometry, and the whole bundle is mapped or unmapped as one
contiguous range.
_Avoid_: CUDA page, KV block

**KV VMM Backing**:
The Instance-Rank-local stable virtual storage, strided per-layer Tensor views,
and physical backing for one KV pool, distinct from the device-wide KV Capacity
Pool and SGLang's logical KV allocator.
_Avoid_: VMM manager, elastic KV pool

**KV Capacity Reconciliation**:
The Instance-Rank-local convergence of a KV Capacity Target and KV Active
Capacity to actual KV VMM Backing while preserving logical allocation and
in-flight device access.
_Avoid_: KV resize, capacity application, VMM policy

**FFN Execution Installation**:
The generation-scoped assembly of FFN computation and the resources needed to
run it.
_Avoid_: Graph install, backend install

**FFN Semantics**:
The closed vocabulary shared across CrossPool for describing an FFN invocation,
its layout, its required output, and its outcome.
_Avoid_: ABI values, Transport FFN enums, Fabric FFN types

**Execution Activation**:
The startup transition that makes an installed FFN execution available to the
generation.
_Avoid_: Execution installation, execution selection

**Compute Branch**:
One selectable FFN computation body within a Lane Graph, separate from the
Lane's waiting, delivery, and lifecycle structure.
_Avoid_: Compute Graph, Lane Graph

**Primary Graph**:
A construction-only FFN graph captured from one representative layer and used
to materialize compatible Compute Branches.
_Avoid_: Primary Layer, production GraphExec

**Control Graph**:
A construction-only companion to the Primary Graph used to discover which
captured parameters vary between compatible layers.
_Avoid_: Control Layer, fallback graph

**Control Capture Probe**:
The temporary shape-equivalent resources that distinguish variable parameters
while comparing a Primary Graph with its Control Graph.
_Avoid_: Control weights, Control Layer resources

**Execution Capacity**:
The padded row capacity of one Compute Branch. It is distinct from live rows,
Executor Lane count, and a compute-load budget.
_Avoid_: Batch size, Lane capacity

**Routing Metadata**:
The final per-row Expert identifiers and weights shared by the FFN participants
for one MoE layer invocation.
_Avoid_: Router output, TopK result

**Hook Point**:
A neutral extension seam named after the production event it exposes rather
than the observer that consumes it.
_Avoid_: Callback site, plugin branch

**Fabric Coordinator**:
The generation-scoped progress owner that forms Invocations, leases Executor
Lanes, commits outputs, and releases acknowledged work.
_Avoid_: FfnAgent Coordinator, Scheduler kernel

**Executor Lane**:
A generation-scoped distributed slot that can own one FFN Invocation at a time.
Its count bounds simultaneous Invocations, not row capacity.
_Avoid_: FFN concurrency, Executor

**Submission Rendezvous**:
The Fabric Coordinator's agreement check over the AtnAgent Submissions that
form the next Invocation for one Instance.
_Avoid_: Invocation handoff, Submission merge

**Canonical Generation Failure**:
The first failure accepted for a Fabric generation and subsequently observed by
every participant.
_Avoid_: Local result, latest failure

**Payload Element Type**:
The scalar type of hidden-state payload elements, distinct from wider types used
for algorithm state or accumulation.
_Avoid_: PayloadDType, dtype code

**Native ABI Version**:
The stopped-world compatibility identity shared by one native extension and its
Python caller.
_Avoid_: ABI probe, Python ABI source

**Exact Resource Ledger**:
The stage-live sum of CrossPool-owned logical Tensor requests and native device
allocations whose sizes follow stable formulas.
_Avoid_: Exact allocation demand, safe estimate

**Analytic Allocator Allowance**:
A history-independent upper bound for allocator overhead beyond the Exact
Resource Ledger.
_Avoid_: Allocation error tolerance, allocator simulator

**Calibrated Overhead Envelope**:
An environment-qualified empirical bound for device-memory overhead not covered
by the Exact Resource Ledger and Analytic Allocator Allowance.
_Avoid_: Universal overhead, default reserve

**Device Observation Quantum**:
The smallest positive unit represented by one run's device-memory observations.
_Avoid_: Pressure quantum, memory margin

**Operator Device-Memory Margin**:
An explicit deployment reserve added after the predicted startup peak.
_Avoid_: Estimator correction, calibration allowance

**Resource Qualification**:
Real-model evidence that the memory estimate admits startup without hiding
systematic underprediction.
_Avoid_: Memory profiling, calibration fitting

**Timeline Session**:
One daemon-created collection identity and bounded disk budget, shared by its
expected Trace Producers.

**Trace Producer**:
One process-local Host recorder or process/device-local Device recorder with its
own creation identity, sequence domain and bounded storage.

**Timeline Chunk**:
An immutable group of committed raw records, published independently by its
Producer. Its lifecycle distinguishes Device receipt from file publication.
