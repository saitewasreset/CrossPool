<h1 align="center">CrossPool</h1>

CrossPool is a serving system for co-locating multiple SGLang models when
user-driven KV Cache demand and model-driven FFN weight requirements do not
line up.

## Why CrossPool?

KV Cache and FFN weights/execution are governed by different sizing axes:

| Resource | Main sizing driver | CrossPool treatment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Attention and KV Cache | Active requests, context lengths, and generation histories | SGLang keeps logical cache ownership; physical backing can be lent and reclaimed among Instances on one attention device. |
| FFN weights and execution | Model layer geometry, weight size, and FFN parallelism | FfnAgents retain model-specific true-TP shards on a shared FFN execution tier. |

A conventional co-located deployment binds these two axes to the same process and
device reservation. One model may need large KV capacity while another mainly
contributes resident FFN weights, yet each Instance must reserve both sides
independently.

CrossPool separates the placement and sizing decisions without changing
SGLang's request semantics. It shares FFN execution infrastructure and
reallocates physical KV backing across co-located Instances. Logical KV contents
and prefix caches remain isolated; CrossPool shares execution infrastructure and
physical capacity, not cache contents.

## Architecture at a glance

</p>

The daemon control plane registers participants, coordinates SLO-aware KV
capacity, and watches participant liveness. Each SGLang Instance Rank keeps
attention and logical KV/prefix-cache ownership, then sends FFN work through a
rank-local mailbox to its AtnAgent's Transport Kernel.

FfnAgents retain model-specific FFN weight shards as reusable GraphTemplates and
replay them through per-lane CUDA Graphs. The Fabric carries the rank-local work
between the AtnAgents and FfnAgents; physical KV backing can move between
co-located Instances without sharing logical KV contents. See the [system
overview](docs/designs/overview.md) for complete process roles, request flow,
and readiness contracts.

## Highlights

- **Seamless SGLang integration:** a pinned SGLang plugin installs
  architecture-specific adapters without replacing SGLang's request or KV Cache
  runtime.
- **Independent resource placement:** attention/KV and FFN/weight sides can be
  configured and sized independently for co-located models.
- **SLO-aware elastic KV Cache backing:** stable attention-side virtual addresses
  allow physical KV capacity to move between co-located Instances while SGLang
  keeps logical allocation and prefix-cache ownership.
- **Layer-wise FFN execution:** FfnAgents retain model-specific weight shards
  and execute model-defined FFN layers through GraphTemplates based on layer
  signatures.

## Requirements

- Linux on x86-64
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) 0.12.17 or newer
- An uv-managed Python 3.12 interpreter
- CUDA Toolkit 13.2 and CCCL 3.2
- NVIDIA devices able to execute the selected kernels and CUDA Graphs, with CUDA
  IPC and NVSHMEM access required by the selected topology; the example uses
  one attention-side device and one FFN-side device
- `nvidia-cuda-mps-control` on PATH for daemon-owned attention MPS
- Local model weights for serving and model-dependent validation

The native extension is built through uv and scikit-build-core, which obtains
suitable CMake and Ninja versions when needed. The system CUDA Toolkit provides
the native compiler and CCCL. CUDA bindings, Torch, SGLang, and the NVIDIA
NVSHMEM runtime are direct project dependencies. uv uses the interpreter pinned
in `.python-version` with managed Python downloads enabled. NVSHMEM runs through
the native C++/CUDA implementation; Python NVSHMEM bindings are not required.

## Quick Start

Follow the [two-device Qwen3-0.6B quick start](docs/tutorials/quick-start.md) to
configure a local checkpoint, start the four serving roles, send an HTTP
request through real FFN execution, and shut everything down in order.
The daemon starts and stops attention-side MPS; FFN processes run directly.

## Configuration

For the complete user-facing reference, see
[Configuration](docs/configuration.md). Start from
[`configs/xpool.example.toml`](configs/xpool.example.toml) and
[`.env.example`](.env.example); the [Quick Start](docs/tutorials/quick-start.md)
shows a complete two-device setup.

## SGLang Integration

CrossPool integrates with SGLang through architecture-discovered adapters. The
model architecture in `config.json` selects the adapter, while the configured
model ID resolves its weights. SGLang continues to own request scheduling,
attention, KV Cache, and output processing; CrossPool adds the shared FFN
execution path and elastic physical KV Cache backing. See
[Supported Models](docs/supported-models.md) for currently qualified model IDs.

Select `xpool` through `SGLANG_PLUGINS` and launch with
`uv run xpool exec -- sglang serve ...`. The generic wrapper normalizes complete
deployment visibility and prepares attention MPS before the target imports its
runtime, preserving arguments, process identity and the inherited process group.

## Validation and Development

`xtest run` is the canonical composition root. It runs native CTest,
Unit, Integration, and E2E stages in their accepted order, schedules device work
against explicit resource requirements, and retains artifacts under
`.xpool-cache/test-runs/`.

```bash
if [ -f .env ]; then export UV_ENV_FILE="$PWD/.env"; fi

# Complete resource-eligible suite.
uv run xtest run

# Selected canonical stages.
uv run xtest run --suite cext --suite integration
uv run xtest run --suite e2e --strict-requirements
```

See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for suite placement, requirements, and
commands, and [Test and Benchmark Tooling](docs/designs/tooling.md) for process,
device allocation, endpoint, and artifact ownership.

The [offline Observer prototype](local_scripts/observability/README.md) provides
operator-run two-GPU experiments, byte-preserved archives, Fabric Invocation
queries and separate GPU traces. Its evidence does not qualify unified clocks
or production timeline recording.

CMake uses ccache for C, C++, and CUDA when available and no compiler launcher
is already configured. To disable it for a build, add
`--config-settings-package xpool:cmake.define.XPOOL_ENABLE_CCACHE=OFF`
to the [Quick Start sync command](docs/tutorials/quick-start.md#install).

## Serving Benchmarks

`xbench` measures multi-model LLM serving through native SGLang streaming. It
supports client-only load against externally owned endpoints and owned execution
that starts the declared CrossPool model combination and topology. Prompt JSONL
or random token prompts combine independently with trace JSONL or Poisson arrivals.
Random prompts require matching local tokenizer/model metadata; inputs are prepared
offline and retained for replay.

`run` computes request metrics and retains them with request/event JSONL and
execution checkpoints. `report` aggregates saved metrics and event samples into
distributions and logical input/output throughput, then exports CSV and
paper-layout PDF/SVG/PNG figures inside each repetition's `report/` directory.
Run inputs expand to independent repetition reports. Repeated reporting
overwrites generated files and preserves unrelated files and the measurement.

```bash
if [ -f .env ]; then export UV_ENV_FILE="$PWD/.env"; fi

uv run xbench list
uv run xbench run --case serving-001
uv run xbench report .xpool-cache/bench-runs/RUN_ID
uv run xbench clean --dry-run
```

The checked-in [catalogue](benches/benches.toml) uses the
[two-Qwen deployment](configs/deployments/Qwen%252FQwen2.5-0.5B+Qwen%252FQwen3-0.6B/atn1-ffn1-lanes2.toml),
one attention device, one direct FFN device, daemon-owned MPS and local
checkpoints resolved from `XPOOL_CONFIG`. Owned cases inherit machine paths
and runtime policy from that
complete configuration while their portable deployment supplies topology and
SLO; optional `runtime_config` selects an explicit base.
Supply `--catalog FILE` for other scenarios; relative input paths resolve against
that catalogue. Each catalogue names a source module below its sibling `suites/`
directory; that program orchestrates the scenario through installed tooling.
Client catalogues declare external endpoints instead of an owned deployment. An
installed invocation outside this checkout supplies an explicit catalogue.

The root `uv sync --group dev` installs the private `xpool-dev` workspace member
editably alongside production `xpool`, using one root lockfile and virtual
environment. Its direct console entries are `xtest.cli:main` and
`xbench.cli:main`; the released `xpool` wheel contains production code and the
`xpool` command. Both development tools expose list/run/report/clean; xtest
inventory and execution require source suites, while offline reports work outside
a checkout.
See [Test and Benchmark Tooling](docs/designs/tooling.md) for ownership, dataset
and metric contracts. Performance values are report-only, not readiness gates.
